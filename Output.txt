 1 .  I'm not happy with what consumers are saying about me on Yelp - should I get my lawyer involved ? We have nothing but love and respect for lawyers ( ahem ) , but you may want to consider the following . First , beware of the so - called Streisand Effect , which can quickly turn a manageable customer service problem into an unmanageable disaster . Lawyers love to draft threatening letters . However , far from being cowed , recipients will sometimes go public with them as a warning to others not to patronize your business . Second , beware of lawyers who are quick to file lawsuits without telling their clients that it can cost them dearly ( see example here ) . Last , take a step back : if you find yourself insisting that a review is obviously untrue , there’s every reason to think that your customers will draw the same conclusion as you . Even if they don’t , Yelp’s recommendation software is always on the prowl , and it may eventually be able to put enough pieces of the puzzle together over the long - term to avoid recommending the bogus review

 2 .  Why does Yelp ask for access to my contacts data ? If you are logged in to Yelp , you have the option to find friends from your phone's contact list that are also on Yelp . You can then decide whether to add them as friends on your Yelp account . This info is also used to auto - populate contact data when adding a Yelp Deals gift for your friends , as well as when placing a reservation with OpenTable , in order to make filling out this information faster and easier . No emails are sent to anyone in your address book without your authorization , we don't expose this contact data to any marketers , and we don't store this contact data any longer than it takes to process the transaction

 3 .  Is Yelp just a place for rants ? How do the reviews break down by rating ? We crunched the numbers and here's what we found ( as of Q4 2017 ) . The numbers don't lie : people love to talk about the things they love


question-answer pair index -   21
 4 .  Should I ask my customers to write reviews for me on Yelp ? No , you shouldn’t ask your customers to post reviews on Yelp . For one thing , most businesses tend to ask their happiest customers to write reviews , not the unhappy ones . These self - selected reviews tell only part of the story , and we don’t think that’s fair to consumers . We would much rather hear from members of the Yelp community who are inspired to talk about their experiences without a business owner’s encouragement . As a result , you shouldn’t be surprised if our software fails to recommend the reviews that you’ve asked your customers to write . Your best bet to get high quality and unbiased reviews about your business is to provide a memorable and amazing customer experience – it has nothing to do with asking your customers to post on Yelp

 5 .  Can Yelp salespeople manipulate reviews for prospective advertisers ? We have every reason to trust the smart , hard - working and ethical salespeople who work at Yelp . Beyond this , to avoid even an appearance of impropriety , we've taken several steps to ensure no member of our team is tempted to game the system . Specifically : Yelp salespeople don't have back - end administrative privileges that would allow them to alter the Yelp review database . Every Yelp salesperson signs an agreement that s/he will not write reviews of any business while employed by Yelp . We trust our teammates in sales to live up to this commitment . We also have several monitoring systems in place to help us ensure nobody ( accidentally or otherwise ) crosses this line . If we ever did find out that a salesperson was trying to game the system , their employment would end that day . When a new advertiser signs up with Yelp , that business owner then participates in a new orientation webinar that , in addition to providing further information about Yelp , confirms that reviews have nothing to do with advertising

 6 .  Do Yelp salespeople take “no” for an answer ? Our salespeople call local businesses to introduce our targeted advertising programs ; we’re trying to establish warm new relationships , never to irritate someone . Persistence is part of sales , and if a business manager asks one of our salespeople to “keep in touch” or “call next week , ” we will ! On the other hand , our salespeople don’t like wasting time ( yours or theirs ) , so if you tell your Yelp sales rep to call back in three months , we’ll do that . And if you really want us never to call again , we will add you to our “Do Not Call” list . Simply notify the member of our sales team who contacted you , or send in your request

 7 .  What does Yelp do with my personal information ? We take privacy very seriously and we hate spam even more than you do . Please take the time to review our privacy policy so you can see exactly what we do with your personal information . If you receive spammy messages from another Yelp member , or if you receive a message that is harassing , abusive , or contains a violation of our Terms of Service , please report it here

 8 .  What is Yelp ? Yelp is an online urban city guide that helps people find cool places to eat , shop , drink , relax and play , based on the informed opinions of a vibrant and active community of locals in the know . Yelp is the fun and easy way to find , review and talk about what's great — and not so great — in your world

 9 .  What is the " Yelp Elite Squad " ? The Yelp Elite Squad is our way of recognizing and rewarding yelpers who are active evangelists and role models , both on and off the site . Elite - worthiness is based on a number of things , including well - written reviews , great tips on mobile , a fleshed - out personal profile , an active voting and complimenting record , and playing nice with others . Members of the Elite Squad are designated by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile .

 10 .  Does Yelp mind if I get a freebie in exchange for my review ? Please don't write a five - star review of your local watering hole in exchange for a free drink . That said , if you independently luck into a free drink or two because of your charming personality , by all means , enjoy the largesse but don't forget to mention the free perks when writing your review

5       47      305.17538       Who can contact me on Yelp ? Other users can contact you on Yelp , including the businesses you review . If you'd prefer not to be contacted by business owners , you may change your settings here . You can also block future messages from specific users by selecting " Block User " under their account name when viewing a message from them
6       16      302.72296       Why would a review not be recommended ? There are a number of reasons why a review might not be recommended . For example , the review might have been posted by a less established user , or it may seem like an unhelpful rant or rave . Some of these reviews are fakes ( like the ones we see originating from the same computer ) and some suggest a bias ( like the ones written by a friend of the business owner ) , but many are real reviews from real customers who we just don’t know much about and therefore can’t recommend
7       12      238.32047       Are reviews displayed in any particular order ? Users can decide for themselves how best to order reviews by clicking one of the links just above the reviews ( e . g . , date , rating , voting , etc . ) . Yelp's default sort order takes a number of factors into account and reflects our own attempt to present reviews in a meaningful order . For example , we'll favor reviews from your friends and the users you follow . The sort algorithm does not take into account whether the business is an advertiser or not
8       21      229.92271       Should I ask my customers to write reviews for me on Yelp ? No , you shouldn’t ask your customers to post reviews on Yelp . For one thing , most businesses tend to ask their happiest customers to write reviews , not the unhappy ones . These self - selected reviews tell only part of the story , and we don’t think that’s fair to consumers . We would much rather hear from members of the Yelp community who are inspired to talk about their experiences without a business owner’s encouragement .

Your best bet to get high quality and unbiased reviews about your business is to provide a memorable and amazing customer experience – it has nothing to do with asking your customers to post on Yelp
9       31      222.06097       How do I verify my Yelp account ? When you've completed the registration process , you will receive an email with a special link . Click it to verify your account . When the verification message arrives in your email in - box , click the verification link , or copy and paste it into your browser . Your account will be verified at this point . If it doesn't work please let us know
10      22      220.50604       Why doesn’t Yelp recommend every review ? There are plenty of review sites that collect and display as many reviews from as many reviewers as possible . Yelp is different ; we try to emphasize a smaller selection of reviews in an effort to keep the focus on helpful and reliable consumer experiences from our core community . We think we’re doing a good job given the sheer volume of reviews we receive and the inevitable differences of opinion that people have when it comes to reviews . At the end of the day , it doesn’t really matter what we think — consumers will only use Yelp if the experiences they read about on Yelp match the experiences they have in real life

 1 .  Where does Yelp get information about how expensive a business is , whether it's good for kids , etc ? These subjective attributes are voted on by users who have reviewed the business . They can change over time as more people review the business and cast more votes .

 5 .  To rank highly in Yelp search results , do businesses have to buy advertising ? Yelp search result pages often feature one or more clearly labeled Yelp Ads , but Yelp’s numbered search results ( all of the other listings in white background ) have absolutely nothing to do with who is paying us . For example , check out this search result for the very popular “Restaurant , San Francisco” query . As of March 2014 , none of the resulting top 10 restaurants is a Yelp advertiser

 6 .  Can Yelp salespeople manipulate reviews for prospective advertisers ? We have every reason to trust the smart , hard - working and ethical salespeople who work at Yelp . Beyond this , to avoid even an appearance of impropriety , we've taken several steps to ensure no member of our team is tempted to game the system . Specifically : Yelp salespeople don't have back - end administrative privileges that would allow them to alter the Yelp review database . Every Yelp salesperson signs an agreement that s/he will not write reviews of any business while employed by Yelp . We trust our teammates in sales to live up to this commitment . We also have several monitoring systems in place to help us ensure nobody ( accidentally or otherwise ) crosses this line . If we ever did find out that a salesperson was trying to game the system , their employment would end that day .

question-answer pair index -   9
 9 .  What's going on ? If your review isn't showing up on a business's page unless you're logged in , your review isn't one of the reviews we are showcasing today for other users . Don't worry : even if your review isn't one of the millions we currently recommend , other people can still see it on your profile page and it might be recommended on another day . You can read more in the " Recommended Reviews " section below


question-answer pair index -   17
 10 .  Do Yelp advertisers get preferential treatment ? No . Our recommendation software treats advertisers and non - advertisers exactly the same . You’ll find plenty of Yelp advertisers with negative reviews , and plenty of non - advertisers with five - star ratings across the board . Furthermore , there is zero relationship between the timing of when a review gets recommended and when a business decides to – or declines to – advertise : reviews can be recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after they were first posted , and your friendly Yelp sales representative doesn’t have any influence over when that might happen . In short , there is no relationship between reviews and anything having to do with Yelp Ads or the Yelp Ads sales process . Period

Task 4: Solr approach
Top 10 questions matching your search
Question No.   Score              Content
1       7       567.8381        Does Yelp mind if I get a freebie in exchange for my review ? Please don't write a five - star review of your local watering hole in exchange for a free drink . That said , if you independently luck into a free drink or two because of your charming personality , by all means , enjoy the largesse but don't forget to mention the free perks when writing your review
2       23      504.3893        Where does Yelp get information about how expensive a business is , whether it's good for kids , etc ? These subjective attributes are voted on by users who have reviewed the business . They can change over time as more people review the business and cast more votes . The more objective attributes that we show in the business listing ( whether the business accepts credit cards or is wheelchair accessible ) can be set by the business owner if he/she has signed up for a free Business Owner's Account
3       14      481.59158       Does Yelp recommend every review from every user ? No . We get millions of reviews from our users , and our job is to showcase the ones that best reflect the opinions of the Yelp community . These recommended reviews comprise about three quarters of the reviews we get . The remaining reviews are accessible from a link at the bottom of each business’s profile page , but they don’t factor into a business’s overall star rating or review count . Note that this approach is very different from other sites that tend to feature every single negative rant and positive rave . We do our best to nurture a community of users who actively contribute reliable and useful content
4       48      469.80582       I'm not happy with what consumers are saying about me on Yelp - should I get my lawyer involved ? We have nothing but love and respect for lawyers ( ahem ) , but you may want to consider the following . First , beware of the so - called Streisand Effect , which can quickly turn a manageable customer service problem into an unmanageable disaster . Lawyers love to draft threatening letters . However , far from being cowed , recipients will sometimes go public with them as a warning to others not to patronize your business . Second , beware of lawyers who are quick to file lawsuits without telling their clients that it can cost them dearly ( see example here ) . Last , take a step back : if you find yourself insisting that a review is obviously untrue , there’s every reason to think that your customers will draw the same conclusion as you . Even if they don’t , Yelp’s recommendation software is always on the prowl , and it may eventually be able to put enough pieces of the puzzle together over the long - term to avoid recommending the bogus review
5       17      466.36423       Do Yelp advertisers get preferential treatment ? No . Our recommendation software treats advertisers and non - advertisers exactly the same . You’ll find plenty of Yelp advertisers with negative reviews , and plenty of non - advertisers with five - star ratings across the board . Furthermore , there is zero relationship between the timing of when a review gets recommended and when a business decides to – or declines to – advertise : reviews can be recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after they were first posted , and your friendly Yelp sales representative doesn’t have any influence over when that might happen . In short , there is no relationship between reviews and anything having to do with Yelp Ads or the Yelp Ads sales process . Period
6       41      413.80148       Why does Yelp ask for access to my contacts data ? If you are logged in to Yelp , you have the option to find friends from your phone's contact list that are also on Yelp . You can then decide whether to add them as friends on your Yelp account . This info is also used to auto - populate contact data when adding a Yelp Deals gift for your friends , as well as when placing a reservation with OpenTable , in order to make filling out this information faster and easier . No emails are sent to anyone in your address book without your authorization , we don't expose this contact data to any marketers , and we don't store this contact data any longer than it takes to process the transaction
7       45      409.1881        What are Regular rankings and how do I move up in rank ? Regulars are ranked according to how many total check - ins they have at a business with more recent check - ins counting more . To move up in rank simply visit the business frequently and remember to check - in . The top Regular ( the Regular ranked #1 ) gets to wear the crown as the Duke or Duchess of the business
8       13      389.74487       Do reviews ever get removed ? Users can remove their own reviews , and our user support team can also remove the ones that violate our Content Guidelines or Terms of Service . Whether a business is a Yelp advertiser has no impact on this whatsoever . We also use automated software to recommend the most helpful and reliable reviews among the millions we get . The ones that aren’t selected are featured less prominently on a business’s page and don’t factor into the business’s overall star rating , but they are not removed from the site . You can read more in the “Recommended Reviews” section below
9       10      386.49463       How do I get the Useful , Funny , and Cool buttons at the bottom of my reviews ? Users can vote on reviews that they think are - you guessed it - Useful , Funny or Cool . You can't vote on your own reviews , but once others begin to realize just how brilliant you are , you'll be racking up the Useful , Funny and Cool votes in no time
10      21      384.23584       Should I ask my customers to write reviews for me on Yelp ? No , you shouldn’t ask your customers to post reviews on Yelp . For one thing , most businesses tend to ask their happiest customers to write reviews , not the unhappy ones . These self - selected reviews tell only part of the story , and we don’t think that’s fair to consumers . We would much rather hear from members of the Yelp community who are inspired to talk about their experiences without a business owner’s encouragement . As a result , you shouldn’t be surprised if our software fails to recommend the reviews that you’ve asked your customers to write . Your best bet to get high quality and unbiased reviews about your business is to provide a memorable and amazing customer experience – it has nothing to do with asking your customers to post on Yelp

 3 .  Does Yelp recommend more positive or negative reviews ? About 80 % of the reviews we recommend are three stars or higher , but that’s mostly just because our users write more positive reviews in the first place . Indeed , researchers at Harvard and Boston University debunked the myth that Yelp skews negative by showing that Yelp recommended far more positive than negative reviews . Of course , a number of positive reviews never make the cut either – that’s perfectly normal too , and assuming there’s no funny business going on ( like someone writing reviews from multiple accounts ) , it’s just the normal operation of the recommendation software trying to highlight the most helpful and reliable reviews regardless of star rating


question-answer pair index -   19
 4 .  Why are different reviews recommended on different days ? Our recommendation software runs on a daily basis , so the results can change on a daily basis . You’ll sometimes see situations where a review is recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after it is initially posted . For example , our recommendation software might pick up new information that makes a reviewer seem more trustworthy than was initially assumed . The reverse also happens . Sometimes , the information we have about a reviewer grows stale or is incomplete , so the software can take that into account too . The important point here is that our recommendation software routinely produces different results on different days based on the information that feeds it

 6 .  Can Yelp salespeople manipulate reviews for prospective advertisers ? We have every reason to trust the smart , hard - working and ethical salespeople who work at Yelp . Beyond this , to avoid even an appearance of impropriety , we've taken several steps to ensure no member of our team is tempted to game the system . Specifically : Yelp salespeople don't have back - end administrative privileges that would allow them to alter the Yelp review database . Every Yelp salesperson signs an agreement that s/he will not write reviews of any business while employed by Yelp . We trust our teammates in sales to live up to this commitment . We also have several monitoring systems in place to help us ensure nobody ( accidentally or otherwise ) crosses this line . If we ever did find out that a salesperson was trying to game the system , their employment would end that day . When a new advertiser signs up with Yelp , that business owner then participates in a new orientation webinar that , in addition to providing further information about Yelp , confirms that reviews have nothing to do with advertising

 7 .  Do Yelp salespeople take “no” for an answer ? Our salespeople call local businesses to introduce our targeted advertising programs ; we’re trying to establish warm new relationships , never to irritate someone . Persistence is part of sales , and if a business manager asks one of our salespeople to “keep in touch” or “call next week , ” we will ! On the other hand , our salespeople don’t like wasting time ( yours or theirs ) , so if you tell your Yelp sales rep to call back in three months , we’ll do that . And if you really want us never to call again , we will add you to our “Do Not Call” list . Simply notify the member of our sales team who contacted you , or send in your request

 8 .  How do I earn a check - in offer ? When you check in to a business that offers one , you'll immediately be presented with a check in offer certificate in the mobile app . You can choose to use it at that time , or save it to use later

 9 .  What is the " Yelp Elite Squad " ? The Yelp Elite Squad is our way of recognizing and rewarding yelpers who are active evangelists and role models , both on and off the site . Elite - worthiness is based on a number of things , including well - written reviews , great tips on mobile , a fleshed - out personal profile , an active voting and complimenting record , and playing nice with others . Members of the Elite Squad are designated by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile .

 10 .  Do reviews ever get removed ? Users can remove their own reviews , and our user support team can also remove the ones that violate our Content Guidelines or Terms of Service . Whether a business is a Yelp advertiser has no impact on this whatsoever . We also use automated software to recommend the most helpful and reliable reviews among the millions we get .

1       39      351.01694       Simply show your phone to an employee of the business to redeem it How do I earn badges ? You can earn badges by checking in to businesses . What type of badge you get depends on what businesses you check into - for example , checking in to many sushi places will earn you the Sushi Sensei badge . You can also earn certain badges by checking into businesses along with your friends
2       40      214.01363       Where can I see all the badges that I or another yelper has earned ? You can view your badges by opening the Yelp mobile app for iPhone , Android , or BlackBerry , and tapping the About Me section . From here you can see how many badges you've earned . You can also view other peoples' badges by viewing their user profile from the mobile app
3       3       200.45764       What is the " Yelp Elite Squad " ? The Yelp Elite Squad is our way of recognizing and rewarding yelpers who are active evangelists and role models , both on and off the site . Elite - worthiness is based on a number of things , including well - written reviews , great tips on mobile , a fleshed - out personal profile , an active voting and complimenting record , and playing nice with others . Members of the Elite Squad are designated by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile . If you think you or someone you know might be ready to be Yelp Elite , visit https : //en . yelp . my/elite
4       48      184.56308       I'm not happy with what consumers are saying about me on Yelp - should I get my lawyer involved ? We have nothing but love and respect for lawyers ( ahem ) , but you may want to consider the following . First , beware of the so - called Streisand Effect , which can quickly turn a manageable customer service problem into an unmanageable disaster . Lawyers love to draft threatening letters . However , far from being cowed , recipients will sometimes go public with them as a warning to others not to patronize your business . Second , beware of lawyers who are quick to file lawsuits without telling their clients that it can cost them dearly ( see example here ) . Last , take a step back : if you find yourself insisting that a review is obviously untrue , there’s every reason to think that your customers will draw the same conclusion as you . Even if they don’t , Yelp’s recommendation software is always on the prowl , and it may eventually be able to put enough pieces of the puzzle together over the long - term to avoid recommending the bogus review
5       37      136.84615       How do I earn a check - in offer ? When you check in to a business that offers one , you'll immediately be presented with a check in offer certificate in the mobile app . You can choose to use it at that time , or save it to use later
6       28      127.64614       Can Yelp salespeople manipulate reviews for prospective advertisers ? We have every reason to trust the smart , hard - working and ethical salespeople who work at Yelp . Beyond this , to avoid even an appearance of impropriety , we've taken several steps to ensure no member of our team is tempted to game the system . Specifically : Yelp salespeople don't have back - end administrative privileges that would allow them to alter the Yelp review database . Every Yelp salesperson signs an agreement that s/he will not write reviews of any business while employed by Yelp . We trust our teammates in sales to live up to this commitment . We also have several monitoring systems in place to help us ensure nobody ( accidentally or otherwise ) crosses this line . If we ever did find out that a salesperson was trying to game the system , their employment would end that day . When a new advertiser signs up with Yelp , that business owner then participates in a new orientation webinar that , in addition to providing further information about Yelp , confirms that reviews have nothing to do with advertising

While Yelp continues to evolve your feedback makes a big difference . If there's something you found unsatisfying about Yelp , tell us about it and we'll do our best to try to do better
8       7       120.54072       Does Yelp mind if I get a freebie in exchange for my review ? Please don't write a five - star review of your local watering hole in exchange for a free drink . That said , if you independently luck into a free drink or two because of your charming personality , by all means , enjoy the largesse but don't forget to mention the free perks when writing your review
9       18      119.939285      Does Yelp recommend more positive or negative reviews ? About 80 % of the reviews we recommend are three stars or higher , but that’s mostly just because our users write more positive reviews in the first place . Indeed , researchers at Harvard and Boston University debunked the myth that Yelp skews negative by showing that Yelp recommended far more positive than negative reviews . Of course , a number of positive reviews never make the cut either – that’s perfectly normal too , and assuming there’s no funny business going on ( like someone writing reviews from multiple accounts ) , it’s just the normal operation of the recommendation software trying to highlight the most helpful and reliable reviews regardless of star rating
10      31      112.3748        How do I verify my Yelp account ? When you've completed the registration process , you will receive an email with a special link . Click it to verify your account .

 1 .  What is Yelp ? Yelp is an online urban city guide that helps people find cool places to eat , shop , drink , relax and play , based on the informed opinions of a vibrant and active community of locals in the know . Yelp is the fun and easy way to find , review and talk about what's great — and not so great — in your world


question-answer pair index -   7
 2 .  Does Yelp mind if I get a freebie in exchange for my review ? Please don't write a five - star review of your local watering hole in exchange for a free drink . That said , if you independently luck into a free drink or two because of your charming personality , by all means , enjoy the largesse but don't forget to mention the free perks when writing your review


question-answer pair index -   9
 3 .  What's going on ? If your review isn't showing up on a business's page unless you're logged in , your review isn't one of the reviews we are showcasing today for other users . Don't worry : even if your review isn't one of the millions we currently recommend , other people can still see it on your profile page and it might be recommended on another day . You can read more in the " Recommended Reviews " section below


question-answer pair index -   17
 4 .  Do Yelp advertisers get preferential treatment ? No . Our recommendation software treats advertisers and non - advertisers exactly the same . You’ll find plenty of Yelp advertisers with negative reviews , and plenty of non - advertisers with five - star ratings across the board . Furthermore , there is zero relationship between the timing of when a review gets recommended and when a business decides to – or declines to – advertise : reviews can be recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after they were first posted , and your friendly Yelp sales representative doesn’t have any influence over when that might happen . In short , there is no relationship between reviews and anything having to do with Yelp Ads or the Yelp Ads sales process . Period

 5 .  Does Yelp recommend more positive or negative reviews ? About 80 % of the reviews we recommend are three stars or higher , but that’s mostly just because our users write more positive reviews in the first place . Indeed , researchers at Harvard and Boston University debunked the myth that Yelp skews negative by showing that Yelp recommended far more positive than negative reviews . Of course , a number of positive reviews never make the cut either – that’s perfectly normal too , and assuming there’s no funny business going on ( like someone writing reviews from multiple accounts ) , it’s just the normal operation of the recommendation software trying to highlight the most helpful and reliable reviews regardless of star rating


question-answer pair index -   22
 6 .  Why doesn’t Yelp recommend every review ? There are plenty of review sites that collect and display as many reviews from as many reviewers as possible . Yelp is different ; we try to emphasize a smaller selection of reviews in an effort to keep the focus on helpful and reliable consumer experiences from our core community . We think we’re doing a good job given the sheer volume of reviews we receive and the inevitable differences of opinion that people have when it comes to reviews . At the end of the day , it doesn’t really matter what we think — consumers will only use Yelp if the experiences they read about on Yelp match the experiences they have in real life


question-answer pair index -   23
 7 .  Where does Yelp get information about how expensive a business is , whether it's good for kids , etc ? These subjective attributes are voted on by users who have reviewed the business . They can change over time as more people review the business and cast more votes . The more objective attributes that we show in the business listing ( whether the business accepts credit cards or is wheelchair accessible ) can be set by the business owner if he/she has signed up for a free Business Owner's Account

 8 .  Can Yelp salespeople manipulate reviews for prospective advertisers ? We have every reason to trust the smart , hard - working and ethical salespeople who work at Yelp .

 9 .  Do Yelp salespeople take “no” for an answer ? Our salespeople call local businesses to introduce our targeted advertising programs ; we’re trying to establish warm new relationships , never to irritate someone . Persistence is part of sales , and if a business manager asks one of our salespeople to “keep in touch” or “call next week , ” we will ! On the other hand , our salespeople don’t like wasting time ( yours or theirs ) , so if you tell your Yelp sales rep to call back in three months , we’ll do that . And if you really want us never to call again , we will add you to our “Do Not Call” list . Simply notify the member of our sales team who contacted you , or send in your request


question-answer pair index -   46
 10 .  What does Yelp do with my personal information ? We take privacy very seriously and we hate spam even more than you do . Please take the time to review our privacy policy so you can see exactly what we do with your personal information . If you receive spammy messages from another Yelp member , or if you receive a message that is harassing , abusive , or contains a violation of our Terms of Service , please report it here

2       16      423.83423       Why would a review not be recommended ? There are a number of reasons why a review might not be recommended . For example , the review might have been posted by a less established user , or it may seem like an unhelpful rant or rave . Some of these reviews are fakes ( like the ones we see originating from the same computer ) and some suggest a bias ( like the ones written by a friend of the business owner ) , but many are real reviews from real customers who we just don’t know much about and therefore can’t recommend

6       19      342.6011        Why are different reviews recommended on different days ? Our recommendation software runs on a daily basis , so the results can change on a daily basis . You’ll sometimes see situations where a review is recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after it is initially posted . For example , our recommendation software might pick up new information that makes a reviewer seem more trustworthy than was initially assumed . The reverse also happens . Sometimes , the information we have about a reviewer grows stale or is incomplete , so the software can take that into account too . The important point here is that our recommendation software routinely produces different results on different days based on the information that feeds it
7       3       290.7476        What is the " Yelp Elite Squad " ? The Yelp Elite Squad is our way of recognizing and rewarding yelpers who are active evangelists and role models , both on and off the site . Elite - worthiness is based on a number of things , including well - written reviews , great tips on mobile , a fleshed - out personal profile , an active voting and complimenting record , and playing nice with others . Members of the Elite Squad are designated by a shiny Elite badge on their account profile . If you think you or someone you know might be ready to be Yelp Elite , visit https : //en . yelp . my/elite
8       18      272.37326       Does Yelp recommend more positive or negative reviews ? About 80 % of the reviews we recommend are three stars or higher , but that’s mostly just because our users write more positive reviews in the first place . Indeed , researchers at Harvard and Boston University debunked the myth that Yelp skews negative by showing that Yelp recommended far more positive than negative reviews . Of course , a number of positive reviews never make the cut either – that’s perfectly normal too , and assuming there’s no funny business going on ( like someone writing reviews from multiple accounts ) , it’s just the normal operation of the recommendation software trying to highlight the most helpful and reliable reviews regardless of star rating
9       7       262.86484       Does Yelp mind if I get a freebie in exchange for my review ? Please don't write a five - star review of your local watering hole in exchange for a free drink . That said , if you independently luck into a free drink or two because of your charming personality , by all means , enjoy the largesse but don't forget to mention the free perks when writing your review
10      45      248.17062       What are Regular rankings and how do I move up in rank ? Regulars are ranked according to how many total check - ins they have at a business with more recent check - ins counting more . To move up in rank simply visit the business frequently and remember to check - in . The top Regular ( the Regular ranked #1 ) gets to wear the crown as the Duke or Duchess of the business

 1 .  What is Yelp ? Yelp is an online urban city guide that helps people find cool places to eat , shop , drink , relax and play , based on the informed opinions of a vibrant and active community of locals in the know .

 3 .  What does Yelp do with my personal information ? We take privacy very seriously and we hate spam even more than you do . Please take the time to review our privacy policy so you can see exactly what we do with your personal information . If you receive spammy messages from another Yelp member , or if you receive a message that is harassing , abusive , or contains a violation of our Terms of Service , please report it here


question-answer pair index -   14
 4 .  Does Yelp recommend every review from every user ? No . We get millions of reviews from our users , and our job is to showcase the ones that best reflect the opinions of the Yelp community . These recommended reviews comprise about three quarters of the reviews we get . The remaining reviews are accessible from a link at the bottom of each business’s profile page , but they don’t factor into a business’s overall star rating or review count . Note that this approach is very different from other sites that tend to feature every single negative rant and positive rave . We do our best to nurture a community of users who actively contribute reliable and useful content


question-answer pair index -   17
 5 .  Do Yelp advertisers get preferential treatment ? No . Our recommendation software treats advertisers and non - advertisers exactly the same . You’ll find plenty of Yelp advertisers with negative reviews , and plenty of non - advertisers with five - star ratings across the board . Furthermore , there is zero relationship between the timing of when a review gets recommended and when a business decides to – or declines to – advertise : reviews can be recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after they were first posted , and your friendly Yelp sales representative doesn’t have any influence over when that might happen . In short , there is no relationship between reviews and anything having to do with Yelp Ads or the Yelp Ads sales process . Period


question-answer pair index -   20
 6 .  Are employees at Yelp allowed to manually override the recommendation software to recommend ( or not recommend ) a particular review ? No . Our recommendation software is automated precisely so that it can apply the same objective standards to every business and every review without being overridden by someone’s personal preferences . As a separate matter , our User Support team can manually remove reviews that violate our Content Guidelines , but there is nothing they can do to monkey with our recommendation software or override it


question-answer pair index -   22
 7 .  Why doesn’t Yelp recommend every review ? There are plenty of review sites that collect and display as many reviews from as many reviewers as possible . Yelp is different ; we try to emphasize a smaller selection of reviews in an effort to keep the focus on helpful and reliable consumer experiences from our core community . We think we’re doing a good job given the sheer volume of reviews we receive and the inevitable differences of opinion that people have when it comes to reviews . At the end of the day , it doesn’t really matter what we think — consumers will only use Yelp if the experiences they read about on Yelp match the experiences they have in real life


question-answer pair index -   28
 8 .  Can Yelp salespeople manipulate reviews for prospective advertisers ? We have every reason to trust the smart , hard - working and ethical salespeople who work at Yelp . Beyond this , to avoid even an appearance of impropriety , we've taken several steps to ensure no member of our team is tempted to game the system . Specifically : Yelp salespeople don't have back - end administrative privileges that would allow them to alter the Yelp review database . Every Yelp salesperson signs an agreement that s/he will not write reviews of any business while employed by Yelp . We trust our teammates in sales to live up to this commitment . We also have several monitoring systems in place to help us ensure nobody ( accidentally or otherwise ) crosses this line . If we ever did find out that a salesperson was trying to game the system , their employment would end that day . When a new advertiser signs up with Yelp , that business owner then participates in a new orientation webinar that , in addition to providing further information about Yelp , confirms that reviews have nothing to do with advertising


question-answer pair index -   48
 9 .  I'm not happy with what consumers are saying about me on Yelp - should I get my lawyer involved ? We have nothing but love and respect for lawyers ( ahem ) , but you may want to consider the following . First , beware of the so - called Streisand Effect , which can quickly turn a manageable customer service problem into an unmanageable disaster . Lawyers love to draft threatening letters . However , far from being cowed , recipients will sometimes go public with them as a warning to others not to patronize your business . Second , beware of lawyers who are quick to file lawsuits without telling their clients that it can cost them dearly ( see example here ) . Last , take a step back : if you find yourself insisting that a review is obviously untrue , there’s every reason to think that your customers will draw the same conclusion as you . Even if they don’t , Yelp’s recommendation software is always on the prowl , and it may eventually be able to put enough pieces of the puzzle together over the long - term to avoid recommending the bogus review

 10 .  Is Yelp just a place for rants ? How do the reviews break down by rating ? We crunched the numbers and here's what we found ( as of Q4 2017 ) . The numbers don't lie : people love to talk about the things they love

Yelp is the fun and easy way to find , review and talk about what's great — and not so great — in your world
3       15      376.36282       How does Yelp decide which reviews to recommend ? We use automated software developed by our engineers to recommend reviews from the Yelp community . The software looks at dozens of different signals , including various measures of quality , reliability , and activity on Yelp . Most of all , however , it’s looking for people who are intrinsically motivated to share the wide range of rich and detailed experiences they have every day with local businesses
4       14      302.49966       Does Yelp recommend every review from every user ? No . We get millions of reviews from our users , and our job is to showcase the ones that best reflect the opinions of the Yelp community . These recommended reviews comprise about three quarters of the reviews we get . The remaining reviews are accessible from a link at the bottom of each business’s profile page , but they don’t factor into a business’s overall star rating or review count . Note that this approach is very different from other sites that tend to feature every single negative rant and positive rave .

Beyond this , to avoid even an appearance of impropriety , we've taken several steps to ensure no member of our team is tempted to game the system .

6       12      295.1963        Are reviews displayed in any particular order ? Users can decide for themselves how best to order reviews by clicking one of the links just above the reviews ( e . g . , date , rating , voting , etc . ) . Yelp's default sort order takes a number of factors into account and reflects our own attempt to present reviews in a meaningful order . For example , we'll favor reviews from your friends and the users you follow . The sort algorithm does not take into account whether the business is an advertiser or not
7       20      279.98978       Are employees at Yelp allowed to manually override the recommendation software to recommend ( or not recommend ) a particular review ? No . Our recommendation software is automated precisely so that it can apply the same objective standards to every business and every review without being overridden by someone’s personal preferences .

8       26      278.9814        Will Yelp remove or reorder bad reviews if a business pays for advertising ? No . You can't pay us to remove or reorder your bad reviews — it's just that simple . It's worth pointing out some additional checks and balances that we build into the system : among other things , we separate the revenue side of our business from the content side of our business , just as a newspaper might put a firewall between their advertising and reporting functions
9       24      250.2831        Do business owners have a voice on Yelp ? Every business owner can claim their business and set up a business owner’s account on Yelp . The free tools provided allow a business owner to respond to reviews , post descriptive information about their business , add photos , and track activity and customer leads from their Yelp page . This is all available at biz . yelp . com
10      5       245.59773       What should I review on Yelp ? Any local business , service or place with a physical presence is fair game . Think : restaurants , shops , bars , salons , spas , dentists , mechanics , parks , museums , etc . Make sure you take a look at our Content Guidelines before you start writing

 1 .  Why does Yelp ask for access to my contacts data ? If you are logged in to Yelp , you have the option to find friends from your phone's contact list that are also on Yelp . You can then decide whether to add them as friends on your Yelp account . This info is also used to auto - populate contact data when adding a Yelp Deals gift for your friends , as well as when placing a reservation with OpenTable , in order to make filling out this information faster and easier . No emails are sent to anyone in your address book without your authorization , we don't expose this contact data to any marketers , and we don't store this contact data any longer than it takes to process the transaction

 2 .  Why does Yelp ask for access to my device's photos & camera ? This allows the app to use your device's camera to upload photos of businesses to Yelp .

No photos are taken or retrieved without your knowledge , and all camera actions require the user to initiate them

 3 .  Does Yelp mind if I get a freebie in exchange for my review ? Please don't write a five - star review of your local watering hole in exchange for a free drink . That said , if you independently luck into a free drink or two because of your charming personality , by all means , enjoy the largesse but don't forget to mention the free perks when writing your review


question-answer pair index -   21
 4 .  Should I ask my customers to write reviews for me on Yelp ? No , you shouldn’t ask your customers to post reviews on Yelp . For one thing , most businesses tend to ask their happiest customers to write reviews , not the unhappy ones . These self - selected reviews tell only part of the story , and we don’t think that’s fair to consumers . We would much rather hear from members of the Yelp community who are inspired to talk about their experiences without a business owner’s encouragement . As a result , you shouldn’t be surprised if our software fails to recommend the reviews that you’ve asked your customers to write . Your best bet to get high quality and unbiased reviews about your business is to provide a memorable and amazing customer experience – it has nothing to do with asking your customers to post on Yelp

1       41      480.34497       Why does Yelp ask for access to my contacts data ? If you are logged in to Yelp , you have the option to find friends from your phone's contact list that are also on Yelp . You can then decide whether to add them as friends on your Yelp account . This info is also used to auto - populate contact data when adding a Yelp Deals gift for your friends , as well as when placing a reservation with OpenTable , in order to make filling out this information faster and easier . No emails are sent to anyone in your address book without your authorization , we don't expose this contact data to any marketers , and we don't store this contact data any longer than it takes to process the transaction
2       47      290.46652       Who can contact me on Yelp ? Other users can contact you on Yelp , including the businesses you review . If you'd prefer not to be contacted by business owners , you may change your settings here . You can also block future messages from specific users by selecting " Block User " under their account name when viewing a message from them
3       29      119.2249        Do Yelp salespeople take “no” for an answer ? Our salespeople call local businesses to introduce our targeted advertising programs ; we’re trying to establish warm new relationships , never to irritate someone . Persistence is part of sales , and if a business manager asks one of our salespeople to “keep in touch” or “call next week , ” we will ! On the other hand , our salespeople don’t like wasting time ( yours or theirs ) , so if you tell your Yelp sales rep to call back in three months , we’ll do that . And if you really want us never to call again , we will add you to our “Do Not Call” list . Simply notify the member of our sales team who contacted you , or send in your request
4       17      112.30986       Do Yelp advertisers get preferential treatment ? No . Our recommendation software treats advertisers and non - advertisers exactly the same . You’ll find plenty of Yelp advertisers with negative reviews , and plenty of non - advertisers with five - star ratings across the board . Furthermore , there is zero relationship between the timing of when a review gets recommended and when a business decides to – or declines to – advertise : reviews can be recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after they were first posted , and your friendly Yelp sales representative doesn’t have any influence over when that might happen . In short , there is no relationship between reviews and anything having to do with Yelp Ads or the Yelp Ads sales process . Period
5       2       104.50039       Who uses Yelp ? You'll find a wide range of people on Yelp , including locals who are " in the know " about what's cool and happening in their city , visitors who want to get an insider's local perspective , and anyone trying to find a great local business
6       28      103.1136        Can Yelp salespeople manipulate reviews for prospective advertisers ? We have every reason to trust the smart , hard - working and ethical salespeople who work at Yelp . Beyond this , to avoid even an appearance of impropriety , we've taken several steps to ensure no member of our team is tempted to game the system . Specifically : Yelp salespeople don't have back - end administrative privileges that would allow them to alter the Yelp review database . Every Yelp salesperson signs an agreement that s/he will not write reviews of any business while employed by Yelp . We trust our teammates in sales to live up to this commitment . We also have several monitoring systems in place to help us ensure nobody ( accidentally or otherwise ) crosses this line . If we ever did find out that a salesperson was trying to game the system , their employment would end that day . When a new advertiser signs up with Yelp , that business owner then participates in a new orientation webinar that , in addition to providing further information about Yelp , confirms that reviews have nothing to do with advertising
7       31      101.75664       How do I verify my Yelp account ? When you've completed the registration process , you will receive an email with a special link . Click it to verify your account . When the verification message arrives in your email in - box , click the verification link , or copy and paste it into your browser . Your account will be verified at this point . If it doesn't work please let us know
8       42      98.83579        Why does Yelp ask for access to my device's photos & camera ? This allows the app to use your device's camera to upload photos of businesses to Yelp . Additionally , the Yelp Monocle feature accesses the camera to overlay business information on - screen wherever the user points their phone . No photos are taken or retrieved without your knowledge , and all camera actions require the user to initiate them
9       19      92.87192        Why are different reviews recommended on different days ? Our recommendation software runs on a daily basis , so the results can change on a daily basis . You’ll sometimes see situations where a review is recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after it is initially posted . For example , our recommendation software might pick up new information that makes a reviewer seem more trustworthy than was initially assumed . The reverse also happens . Sometimes , the information we have about a reviewer grows stale or is incomplete , so the software can take that into account too . The important point here is that our recommendation software routinely produces different results on different days based on the information that feeds it
10      13      86.01169        Do reviews ever get removed ? Users can remove their own reviews , and our user support team can also remove the ones that violate our Content Guidelines or Terms of Service . Whether a business is a Yelp advertiser has no impact on this whatsoever . We also use automated software to recommend the most helpful and reliable reviews among the millions we get . The ones that aren’t selected are featured less prominently on a business’s page and don’t factor into the business’s overall star rating , but they are not removed from the site . You can read more in the “Recommended Reviews” section below

 1 .  Does Yelp mind if I get a freebie in exchange for my review ? Please don't write a five - star review of your local watering hole in exchange for a free drink . That said , if you independently luck into a free drink or two because of your charming personality , by all means , enjoy the largesse but don't forget to mention the free perks when writing your review


question-answer pair index -   21
 2 .  Should I ask my customers to write reviews for me on Yelp ? No , you shouldn’t ask your customers to post reviews on Yelp . For one thing , most businesses tend to ask their happiest customers to write reviews , not the unhappy ones . These self - selected reviews tell only part of the story , and we don’t think that’s fair to consumers . We would much rather hear from members of the Yelp community who are inspired to talk about their experiences without a business owner’s encouragement . As a result , you shouldn’t be surprised if our software fails to recommend the reviews that you’ve asked your customers to write . Your best bet to get high quality and unbiased reviews about your business is to provide a memorable and amazing customer experience – it has nothing to do with asking your customers to post on Yelp

 3 .  I'm not happy with what consumers are saying about me on Yelp - should I get my lawyer involved ? We have nothing but love and respect for lawyers ( ahem ) , but you may want to consider the following . First , beware of the so - called Streisand Effect , which can quickly turn a manageable customer service problem into an unmanageable disaster . Lawyers love to draft threatening letters . However , far from being cowed , recipients will sometimes go public with them as a warning to others not to patronize your business . Second , beware of lawyers who are quick to file lawsuits without telling their clients that it can cost them dearly ( see example here ) . Last , take a step back : if you find yourself insisting that a review is obviously untrue , there’s every reason to think that your customers will draw the same conclusion as you . Even if they don’t , Yelp’s recommendation software is always on the prowl , and it may eventually be able to put enough pieces of the puzzle together over the long - term to avoid recommending the bogus review

 4 .  How do I get the Useful , Funny , and Cool buttons at the bottom of my reviews ? Users can vote on reviews that they think are - you guessed it - Useful , Funny or Cool .

 5 .  Does Yelp recommend every review from every user ? No . We get millions of reviews from our users , and our job is to showcase the ones that best reflect the opinions of the Yelp community .

Note that this approach is very different from other sites that tend to feature every single negative rant and positive rave .

You can view your badges by opening the Yelp mobile app for iPhone , Android , or BlackBerry , and tapping the About Me section . From here you can see how many badges you've earned . You can also view other peoples' badges by viewing their user profile from the mobile app
2       2       225.55289       Who uses Yelp ? You'll find a wide range of people on Yelp , including locals who are " in the know " about what's cool and happening in their city , visitors who want to get an insider's local perspective , and anyone trying to find a great local business

Everyone can read your reviews and take a look at your account profile , photos , bookmarks , and other content that you've contributed to the site . Your public profile will be tied to your first name and last initial ( e . g . , " Jeremy S . " ) . Other than just stumbling upon you and your great reviews by browsing the site , other people can find you using the " Member Search " feature , Facebook's " Instant Personalization " feature , and the various features that allow users to add their friends on Yelp .

4       0       207.70653       What is Yelp ? Yelp is an online urban city guide that helps people find cool places to eat , shop , drink , relax and play , based on the informed opinions of a vibrant and active community of locals in the know . Yelp is the fun and easy way to find , review and talk about what's great — and not so great — in your world

What type of badge you get depends on what businesses you check into - for example , checking in to many sushi places will earn you the Sushi Sensei badge . You can also earn certain badges by checking into businesses along with your friends
6       38      173.04367       How do I redeem a check - in offer ? From your mobile app , visit the Deals section and tap " My Deals " , which holds all of the offers you've earned

8       28      157.33435       Can Yelp salespeople manipulate reviews for prospective advertisers ? We have every reason to trust the smart , hard - working and ethical salespeople who work at Yelp . Beyond this , to avoid even an appearance of impropriety , we've taken several steps to ensure no member of our team is tempted to game the system . Specifically : Yelp salespeople don't have back - end administrative privileges that would allow them to alter the Yelp review database . Every Yelp salesperson signs an agreement that s/he will not write reviews of any business while employed by Yelp . We trust our teammates in sales to live up to this commitment . We also have several monitoring systems in place to help us ensure nobody ( accidentally or otherwise ) crosses this line . If we ever did find out that a salesperson was trying to game the system , their employment would end that day . When a new advertiser signs up with Yelp , that business owner then participates in a new orientation webinar that , in addition to providing further information about Yelp , confirms that reviews have nothing to do with advertising

10      48      154.80235       I'm not happy with what consumers are saying about me on Yelp - should I get my lawyer involved ? We have nothing but love and respect for lawyers ( ahem ) , but you may want to consider the following . First , beware of the so - called Streisand Effect , which can quickly turn a manageable customer service problem into an unmanageable disaster . Lawyers love to draft threatening letters . However , far from being cowed , recipients will sometimes go public with them as a warning to others not to patronize your business . Second , beware of lawyers who are quick to file lawsuits without telling their clients that it can cost them dearly ( see example here ) . Last , take a step back : if you find yourself insisting that a review is obviously untrue , there’s every reason to think that your customers will draw the same conclusion as you . Even if they don’t , Yelp’s recommendation software is always on the prowl , and it may eventually be able to put enough pieces of the puzzle together over the long - term to avoid recommending the bogus review

 3 .  Do reviews ever get removed ? Users can remove their own reviews , and our user support team can also remove the ones that violate our Content Guidelines or Terms of Service . Whether a business is a Yelp advertiser has no impact on this whatsoever . We also use automated software to recommend the most helpful and reliable reviews among the millions we get . The ones that aren’t selected are featured less prominently on a business’s page and don’t factor into the business’s overall star rating , but they are not removed from the site .

 4 .  Should I ask my customers to write reviews for me on Yelp ? No , you shouldn’t ask your customers to post reviews on Yelp . For one thing , most businesses tend to ask their happiest customers to write reviews , not the unhappy ones . These self - selected reviews tell only part of the story , and we don’t think that’s fair to consumers . We would much rather hear from members of the Yelp community who are inspired to talk about their experiences without a business owner’s encouragement . As a result , you shouldn’t be surprised if our software fails to recommend the reviews that you’ve asked your customers to write . Your best bet to get high quality and unbiased reviews about your business is to provide a memorable and amazing customer experience – it has nothing to do with asking your customers to post on Yelp

 5 .  Do business owners have a voice on Yelp ? Every business owner can claim their business and set up a business owner’s account on Yelp .

1       30      307.3045        How is the ranking of search results determined ? Yelp's search results are based on an algorithm that is designed to provide the best results based on a number of different factors including review text , ratings , and number of reviews . We are constantly working on improving our search results so that we can deliver the most relevant local results to our users
2       27      290.84824       To rank highly in Yelp search results , do businesses have to buy advertising ? Yelp search result pages often feature one or more clearly labeled Yelp Ads , but Yelp’s numbered search results ( all of the other listings in white background ) have absolutely nothing to do with who is paying us . For example , check out this search result for the very popular “Restaurant , San Francisco” query . As of March 2014 , none of the resulting top 10 restaurants is a Yelp advertiser
3       34      225.93764       Who can find me and my reviews on Yelp ?

4       9       150.03873       What's going on ? If your review isn't showing up on a business's page unless you're logged in , your review isn't one of the reviews we are showcasing today for other users . Don't worry : even if your review isn't one of the millions we currently recommend , other people can still see it on your profile page and it might be recommended on another day . You can read more in the " Recommended Reviews " section below
5       18      149.72366       Does Yelp recommend more positive or negative reviews ? About 80 % of the reviews we recommend are three stars or higher , but that’s mostly just because our users write more positive reviews in the first place . Indeed , researchers at Harvard and Boston University debunked the myth that Yelp skews negative by showing that Yelp recommended far more positive than negative reviews . Of course , a number of positive reviews never make the cut either – that’s perfectly normal too , and assuming there’s no funny business going on ( like someone writing reviews from multiple accounts ) , it’s just the normal operation of the recommendation software trying to highlight the most helpful and reliable reviews regardless of star rating
6       13      143.13364       Do reviews ever get removed ?

 6 .  Are reviews displayed in any particular order ? Users can decide for themselves how best to order reviews by clicking one of the links just above the reviews ( e . g . , date , rating , voting , etc . ) . Yelp's default sort order takes a number of factors into account and reflects our own attempt to present reviews in a meaningful order .

 8 .  Does Yelp recommend every review from every user ? No . We get millions of reviews from our users , and our job is to showcase the ones that best reflect the opinions of the Yelp community . These recommended reviews comprise about three quarters of the reviews we get . The remaining reviews are accessible from a link at the bottom of each business’s profile page , but they don’t factor into a business’s overall star rating or review count . Note that this approach is very different from other sites that tend to feature every single negative rant and positive rave . We do our best to nurture a community of users who actively contribute reliable and useful content


question-answer pair index -   17
 9 .  Do Yelp advertisers get preferential treatment ? No . Our recommendation software treats advertisers and non - advertisers exactly the same . You’ll find plenty of Yelp advertisers with negative reviews , and plenty of non - advertisers with five - star ratings across the board . Furthermore , there is zero relationship between the timing of when a review gets recommended and when a business decides to – or declines to – advertise : reviews can be recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after they were first posted , and your friendly Yelp sales representative doesn’t have any influence over when that might happen . In short , there is no relationship between reviews and anything having to do with Yelp Ads or the Yelp Ads sales process . Period

Of course , a number of positive reviews never make the cut either – that’s perfectly normal too , and assuming there’s no funny business going on ( like someone writing reviews from multiple accounts ) , it’s just the normal operation of the recommendation software trying to highlight the most helpful and reliable reviews regardless of star rating

1       9       143.31349       What's going on ? If your review isn't showing up on a business's page unless you're logged in , your review isn't one of the reviews we are showcasing today for other users . Don't worry : even if your review isn't one of the millions we currently recommend , other people can still see it on your profile page and it might be recommended on another day .

2       15      140.56073       How does Yelp decide which reviews to recommend ? We use automated software developed by our engineers to recommend reviews from the Yelp community . The software looks at dozens of different signals , including various measures of quality , reliability , and activity on Yelp . Most of all , however , it’s looking for people who are intrinsically motivated to share the wide range of rich and detailed experiences they have every day with local businesses
3       13      137.38396       Do reviews ever get removed ? Users can remove their own reviews , and our user support team can also remove the ones that violate our Content Guidelines or Terms of Service . Whether a business is a Yelp advertiser has no impact on this whatsoever . We also use automated software to recommend the most helpful and reliable reviews among the millions we get . The ones that aren’t selected are featured less prominently on a business’s page and don’t factor into the business’s overall star rating , but they are not removed from the site . You can read more in the “Recommended Reviews” section below
4       16      132.014 Why would a review not be recommended ? There are a number of reasons why a review might not be recommended . For example , the review might have been posted by a less established user , or it may seem like an unhelpful rant or rave . Some of these reviews are fakes ( like the ones we see originating from the same computer ) and some suggest a bias ( like the ones written by a friend of the business owner ) , but many are real reviews from real customers who we just don’t know much about and therefore can’t recommend
5       14      131.99748       Does Yelp recommend every review from every user ? No . We get millions of reviews from our users , and our job is to showcase the ones that best reflect the opinions of the Yelp community . These recommended reviews comprise about three quarters of the reviews we get . The remaining reviews are accessible from a link at the bottom of each business’s profile page , but they don’t factor into a business’s overall star rating or review count . Note that this approach is very different from other sites that tend to feature every single negative rant and positive rave . We do our best to nurture a community of users who actively contribute reliable and useful content
6       18      121.172585      Does Yelp recommend more positive or negative reviews ? About 80 % of the reviews we recommend are three stars or higher , but that’s mostly just because our users write more positive reviews in the first place . Indeed , researchers at Harvard and Boston University debunked the myth that Yelp skews negative by showing that Yelp recommended far more positive than negative reviews . Of course , a number of positive reviews never make the cut either – that’s perfectly normal too , and assuming there’s no funny business going on ( like someone writing reviews from multiple accounts ) , it’s just the normal operation of the recommendation software trying to highlight the most helpful and reliable reviews regardless of star rating
7       20      117.57037       Are employees at Yelp allowed to manually override the recommendation software to recommend ( or not recommend ) a particular review ? No . Our recommendation software is automated precisely so that it can apply the same objective standards to every business and every review without being overridden by someone’s personal preferences . As a separate matter , our User Support team can manually remove reviews that violate our Content Guidelines , but there is nothing they can do to monkey with our recommendation software or override it
8       22      112.16358       Why doesn’t Yelp recommend every review ? There are plenty of review sites that collect and display as many reviews from as many reviewers as possible . Yelp is different ; we try to emphasize a smaller selection of reviews in an effort to keep the focus on helpful and reliable consumer experiences from our core community . We think we’re doing a good job given the sheer volume of reviews we receive and the inevitable differences of opinion that people have when it comes to reviews . At the end of the day , it doesn’t really matter what we think — consumers will only use Yelp if the experiences they read about on Yelp match the experiences they have in real life
9       21      110.45819       Should I ask my customers to write reviews for me on Yelp ? No , you shouldn’t ask your customers to post reviews on Yelp . For one thing , most businesses tend to ask their happiest customers to write reviews , not the unhappy ones . These self - selected reviews tell only part of the story , and we don’t think that’s fair to consumers . We would much rather hear from members of the Yelp community who are inspired to talk about their experiences without a business owner’s encouragement . As a result , you shouldn’t be surprised if our software fails to recommend the reviews that you’ve asked your customers to write . Your best bet to get high quality and unbiased reviews about your business is to provide a memorable and amazing customer experience – it has nothing to do with asking your customers to post on Yelp
10      17      110.27603       Do Yelp advertisers get preferential treatment ? No . Our recommendation software treats advertisers and non - advertisers exactly the same . You’ll find plenty of Yelp advertisers with negative reviews , and plenty of non - advertisers with five - star ratings across the board . Furthermore , there is zero relationship between the timing of when a review gets recommended and when a business decides to – or declines to – advertise : reviews can be recommended or not recommended days , weeks , or even months after they were first posted , and your friendly Yelp sales representative doesn’t have any influence over when that might happen . In short , there is no relationship between reviews and anything having to do with Yelp Ads or the Yelp Ads sales process . Period
