 1 .  How do I get the Useful , Funny , and Cool buttons at the bottom of my reviews ? Users can vote on reviews that they think are - you guessed it - Useful , Funny or Cool . You can't vote on your own reviews , but once others begin to realize just how brilliant you are , you'll be racking up the Useful , Funny and Cool votes in no time

 2 .  Are reviews displayed in any particular order ? Users can decide for themselves how best to order reviews by clicking one of the links just above the reviews ( e . g . , date , rating , voting , etc . ) . Yelp's default sort order takes a number of factors into account and reflects our own attempt to present reviews in a meaningful order . For example , we'll favor reviews from your friends and the users you follow . The sort algorithm does not take into account whether the business is an advertiser or not

 6 .  Can business owners publicly comment on my reviews ? We've created a feature that allows business owners to publicly comment on a review . You are able to message them back if they post a public comment on your review . My review doesn't show on the business's profile page unless I'm logged in

 7 .  What's going on ? If your review isn't showing up on a business's page unless you're logged in , your review isn't one of the reviews we are showcasing today for other users . Don't worry : even if your review isn't one of the millions we currently recommend , other people can still see it on your profile page and it might be recommended on another day . You can read more in the " Recommended Reviews " section below

 8 .  Do reviews ever get removed ? Users can remove their own reviews , and our user support team can also remove the ones that violate our Content Guidelines or Terms of Service . Whether a business is a Yelp advertiser has no impact on this whatsoever . We also use automated software to recommend the most helpful and reliable reviews among the millions we get . The ones that aren’t selected are featured less prominently on a business’s page and don’t factor into the business’s overall star rating , but they are not removed from the site . You can read more in the “Recommended Reviews” section below

 9 .  How does Yelp decide which reviews to recommend ? We use automated software developed by our engineers to recommend reviews from the Yelp community . The software looks at dozens of different signals , including various measures of quality , reliability , and activity on Yelp . Most of all , however , it’s looking for people who are intrinsically motivated to share the wide range of rich and detailed experiences they have every day with local businesses

 10 .  Should I ask my customers to write reviews for me on Yelp ? No , you shouldn’t ask your customers to post reviews on Yelp . For one thing , most businesses tend to ask their happiest customers to write reviews , not the unhappy ones . These self - selected reviews tell only part of the story , and we don’t think that’s fair to consumers . We would much rather hear from members of the Yelp community who are inspired to talk about their experiences without a business owner’s encouragement . As a result , you shouldn’t be surprised if our software fails to recommend the reviews that you’ve asked your customers to write . Your best bet to get high quality and unbiased reviews about your business is to provide a memorable and amazing customer experience – it has nothing to do with asking your customers to post on Yelp
